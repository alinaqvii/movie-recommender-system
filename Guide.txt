Data -> Prepocessing -> model -> website -> deploy

New Dataset
-movieid -title - tags

Vectorization techniques
- bag of words
- tf idf
- word to vec

we will use bag of words technique

first we will apply stemming(to reduce the same words) than perform vectorization
- euclidean distance(tip to tip distance)
- cosine distance(which is related to angle)

we will will use cosine distance
In a high dimentional data euclidean distance is not a good measure

In pycharm we will create newapp.py file
- We will import streamlit

https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/{movie_id}?api_key=fcad13928ddfab9eb98be62830242296&language=en-US

procfile
.gitignore
setup.sh
pip freeze > requirements.txt


then we will login to heroku

Install Heroku CLI
